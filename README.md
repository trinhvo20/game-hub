## About the Project 

I have built this project to self-taught React. What I have implemented in this project are:

- Build front-end apps with **React** and **TypeScript**.
- Build reusable function components.
- Style my components using vanilla **CSS**, CSS modules, CSS-in-JS, and **Chakra UI**.
- Manage component state.
- Build forms with **React Hook Forms**.
- Implement form validation using **useRef**.
- Connect my React apps to the backend using **RAWG Video Games Database API**.
- Deploy my React apps using **Vercel** 
- Use **VSCode** shortcuts to increase productivity.
- Write clean code.
